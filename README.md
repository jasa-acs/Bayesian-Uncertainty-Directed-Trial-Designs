## Data

### Abstract 
Examples and results in the article do not depend on external data. Parameters used in the
simulation studies are available via the supplementary R file `BUD_Simulations_JASA.R`.

### Availability 
Parameters used in the simulation studies are available via the supplementary R file
`BUD_Simulations_JASA.R.`

## Code

### Abstract
The R code in the supplementary material can be used to simulate BUD designs. Tables and
figures in the manuscript, which compare selected operating characteristics of BUD and
alternative designs, can be reproduced with the provided R code. Simulations in the manuscript
were conducted using R-3.3.

### Description 
The R-file `BUD_Simulations_JASA.R` can be use to generate the four examples in the paper.
The R script consists of four main components (examples 1 to 4). At the beginning of each
component the user has to load the script `BUD_Functions_JASA_Example_x.R`, (x=1, 2, 3, 4),
using the indicated source command, which contains functions to simulate trials under all
considered designs.

### Reproducibility 
Tables and Figures in the main text can be reproduced using the supplementary R scripts.
